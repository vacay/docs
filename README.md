### Collect, organize, and play music from all over.
You can add music to vacay from many sites (soundcloud, youtube, bandcamp, mixcloud, hypem). [Learn more.](https://vacay.io/discussion/41) Once it's in our system, Vacay then lets you organize your music and play (or even download) it whenever you'd like.

### Nomenclature
* **vitamin** - A recording.
* **prescription** - A mixtape.
* **crate** - Your personal collection.
* **tag** - A way of categorizing and organzing your collection. A better approach to playlisting.

### Prescriptions
Very much like a mixtape, prescriptions are a compilation of music put together in a specific order. It may include a selection of favourite songs, or music linked by theme or mood. Prescriptions are solely intended for the betterment of the community and curing its receipients of ailments. Do not make prescriptions for your own benefit... you wouldn't want your doctor doing the same.

### Contributing
vacay is a personal project/hobby. Many of its features are half-baked and the UX needs a lot of work. I will continue to maintain and work on it as a side project. If you want to help realize its full potential there are many ways to get involved, mainly:

* Be an active member of the community in any way you see fit - your unique perspective alone is enough to provide value to the community
* Get involved in any aspect of the development process (planning, evaluation, building, analysis). Create [discussions](https://vacay.io/discussions) that provide feedback or suggest improvements
* Attract tastemakers & active music fans

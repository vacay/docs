## Collect, organize, and play music from all over.
You can add music to vacay from most major music sites (soundcloud, youtube, bandcamp, mixcloud, hypem, [and more](https://vacay.io/discussion/41)).  Once it's in our system, Vacay then lets you organize your music and play (or even download) it whenever you'd like.

Vacay uses [audio fingerprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_fingerprint) to consolidate music sources and services - so that when you play a song - we choose the highest quality stream available online from all of the sources we monitor.

### Contributing
vacay is a personal project/hobby that has driven me to learn programming over the last 2 years. Many of its features are half-baked and the UX needs a lot of work. I will no longer be heavily developing it as it has been overpowered by a desire to bring about radical decentralization. I will continue to maintain and work on it as a side project. If you want to help realize its full potential there are many ways to get involved, mainly:

* Be an active member of the community in any way you see fit - your unique perspective alone is enough to provide value to the community
* get involved in any aspect of the development process (planning, evaluation, building, analysis). Create [discussions](https://vacay.io/discussions) that provide feedback or suggest improvements
* attract tastemakers & active music fans

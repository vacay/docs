## Vacay let's you collect, organize, and play music from all over on the internet.
You can add music to vacay from most major music sites (soundcloud, youtube, bandcamp, mixcloud, hypem, [and more](https://vacay.io/discussion/41)).  Once it's in our system, Vacay then lets you organize your music and play (or even download) it whenever you'd like.

Vacay uses audio fingerprints to consolidate music sources and services - so that when you play a song - we choose the highest quality stream available online from all of the sources we monitor.

### Contributing
vacay is a personal project/hobby that has driven me to learn programming over the last 2 years. Many of its features are half-baked and the UX needs a lot of work. I will no longer be heavily developing it as it has been overpowered by a desire to bring about radical decentralization. I will continue to maintain and work on it as a side project. If you want to help realize its full potential there are many ways to get involved, mainly:

* in general, be an active member of the community in any way you see fit - your unique perspective alone is enough to provide value to the community
* get involved in any aspect of the development process (planning, evaluation, building, analysis). Create [discussions](https://vacay.io/discussions) that provide feedback or suggest improvements
* attract tastemakers & active music fans

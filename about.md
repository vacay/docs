### Collect, organize, and play music from all over.
You can add music to vacay from many sites (soundcloud, youtube, bandcamp, mixcloud, hypem). [Learn more.](https://vacay.io/discussion/41) Once it's in our system, Vacay then lets you organize your music and play (or even download) it whenever you'd like.

### Nomenclature
* **vitamin** - A recording.
* **prescription** - A mixtape.
* **crate** - Your personal collection.
* **tag** - A way of categorizing and organzing your collection for improved searching. A better approach to playlisting.

### Prescriptions
Very much like a mixtape, prescriptions are a compilation of music put together in a specific order. It may include a selection of favourite songs, or music linked by theme or mood. Prescriptions are solely intended for the betterment of the community and curing its receipients of ailments. Do not make prescriptions for your own benefit... you wouldn't want your doctor doing the same.

### Inbox
A personal configurable music feed for vacay (and the internet). By subscribing to users, you can receive prescriptions from them. By subscribing to pages on the internet, you will receive vitamins as they are added to the page.

### How to add music & pages to vacay
Easily import music and convert pages on the internet into music feeds & playlists. There are a few ways:
* copy and paste the url into the vacay search bar
* add 'vacay.io/' to the begnining of any URL in the address bar in your browser
* [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vacay/mgogmlhnenlkmngbdoclecmgbldfjbpj)
* bookmarklet - add pages while on them, using any desktop browser. Drag this button <a class="bookmarklet" href="javascript:void(open('https://vacay.io/search?q=' + window.location,'',''))">+ vacay</a> to your bookmarks bar to add music while browsing other websites & convert the page that you are on into a streamable playlist. Make sure your bookmarks bar is visible before you start dragging...

### Additional Features

* a searchable music crate with tagging support
* a listening queue
* a searchable listening history (with date, device info and location)
* [listen in mode](https://vacay.io/discussion/43) - listen along in realtime with othere users on the site
* [remote control mode](https://vacay.io/discussion/31) - when vacay is open in two or more places, audio will be played from one but you can control it from all connections

### keyboard shortcuts

* **spacebar** : play/puase

### Vision
* attracting active music fans (tastemakers & curators) to power a music recommendation service for passive listeners
* an entirely decentralized & frictionless music distribution network with compensation for seeders & creators
* integration of music & event discovery - for example you can subscribe to djs/artists to receive the tracks they play live.
* empowering and building the brands of artists & tastemakers

### Values / Culture
* pro community owned, driven & governed
* pro radical decentralization
* anti incentivized music sharing/broadcasting/promotion
* pro original content
* pro attribution of content
* pro open data & source
* anti technologically replaceable intermediaries

### Under the hood
* Vacay uses [audio fingerprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_fingerprint) to consolidate music sources and services - so that when you play a song - we choose the highest quality stream available online from all of the sources we monitor.

### Contributing
vacay is a personal project/hobby. Many of its features are half-baked and the UX needs a lot of work. I will continue to maintain and work on it as a side project. If you want to help realize its full potential there are many ways to get involved, mainly:

* Be an active member of the community in any way you see fit - your unique perspective alone is enough to provide value to the community
* Get involved in any aspect of the development process (planning, evaluation, building, analysis). Create [discussions](https://vacay.io/discussions) that provide feedback or suggest improvements
* Attract tastemakers & active music fans

#### What if I receive a Copyright Complaint (DMCA) notification?
If you receive a notification that a Vitamin has been removed due a copyright complaint, it means that the Vitamin has been deleted from Vacay at the request of the content's owner. If your account receives too many copyright complaints, you may lose the ability to add new content on Vacay, and your account may be disabled completely.

If you believe a Vitamin was removed in error, you have the option to file a counter-notice by following the steps below. When we receive a valid counter-notice, we will forward a copy to the person who filed the original complaint. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the submitter of the original complaint is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the content at issue, we will remove the complaint from your account's record, and we may replace the content that was removed.

Note: There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Before submitting a counter-notice, be sure that you are the actual rights holder of the removed content or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.

#### How to File a Counter-Notice
Email your counter-notice to admin@vacay.io.
Include ALL of the following:

* Your name, address, and telephone number.
* DMCA ID printed at the bottom of the notification email.
* The source address of the content that was removed (copy and paste the link in the notification email).
* A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed in error.
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Vacay may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.
* A physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).
